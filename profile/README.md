### Quantum Approaches to Protein Folding

Welcome to the **QFold-Thesis** research organization. This hub hosts the source code, documentation, and experimental results for our research on solving the **Protein Folding Problem** using **Quantum Computing**.

Our work focuses on implementing lattice-based models on universal gate-based quantum computers using variational algorithms.

## 🔬 Research Scope

Our implementation explores the efficiency of **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)** in finding the native conformation of amino acid sequences.

1.  **Abstraction:** Mapping biological constraints to the quantum lattice model.
2.  **Hamiltonian Design:** Constructing energy operators that penalize chain breaks and reward hydrophobic contacts.
3.  **Optimization:** Utilizing classical optimizers (COBYLA, SPSA) to drive the quantum ansatz toward the ground state.
